# Theme Switcher Component

This project demonstrates a Theme Switcher built using React, leveraging Context API and hooks for state management. The switcher allows users to toggle between light and dark modes, dynamically changing the appearance of the page.

# Key Features:

* React Hooks: Uses useContext and useState to manage and update the theme across components.
* Context API: Provides a global theme context, making it easy to toggle the theme from any part of the application.
* Local State Persistence: Stores the theme preference locally, ensuring that the selected theme is remembered across sessions.
* Modular Design: Components are designed to be reusable and easy to integrate into any React project.
